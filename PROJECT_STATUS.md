## üîß Recent Fixes (October 7, 2025)

### Admin Dashboard Fix ‚úÖ

**Issue:** Admin dashboard displayed zeros and couldn't load data  
**Root Causes:**

1. Frontend token key mismatch (viego_token vs access_token)
2. JWT identity type error (integer vs string)
3. Database schema missing 31 columns
4. Invalid enum values in database

**Resolution:**

- Fixed token key consistency across 3 frontend files
- Updated JWT identity type in auth.py (2 locations)
- Added 31 missing columns to database (posts, comments, users)
- Fixed data integrity issues (content_type enum)
- Updated User model with email_verified field

**Files Modified:**

- Frontend: 3 files
- Backend: 3 files
- Database: 3 tables

**Result:** All admin dashboard features now fully functional ‚úÖ

See [ADMIN_FIX_FINAL_SUMMARY.md](./ADMIN_FIX_FINAL_SUMMARY.md) for detailed fix documentation.
