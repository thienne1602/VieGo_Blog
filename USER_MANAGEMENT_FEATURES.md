### State Management

```typescript
// Modal states
const [editUserModal, setEditUserModal] = useState<any>(null);
const [viewUserModal, setViewUserModal] = useState<any>(null);
const [confirmModal, setConfirmModal] = useState<any>(null);

// Form data in EditUserModal
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  fullName: string,
  email: string,
  bio: string,
  location: string,
  role: string,
});
```

### Action Handler

```typescript
const handleUserAction = async (action: string, userId: number) => {
  // Handles: 'edit', 'view', 'ban', 'unban', 'delete'
  // Opens appropriate modal or performs action
  // Shows confirmation for destructive actions
};
```

3. **Confirmation Required:** Destructive actions need confirmation
4. **Role Changes:** Warning displayed when changing roles
5. **Soft Delete:** Users are deactivated, not permanently deleted
